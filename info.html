            <p>When Vin first picked up this dusty old
              <a class="text__link" href="https://all-auto.org/465-bystryy-i-kompaktnyy-avtomobil-nissan-240-sx.html">Nissan 240sx</a>,
            it had seen better days. Much... much better days.
            But he had some grand plans, including 1JZ swap under
            the hood (from our pals at JDM of California),
            some fresh paint, and some body bits.
            And after a summer's worth of toiling and building,
            Vin's s14 came out wider, 5x faster, and WAY better looking.
            Putting down around 550hp to the crank, and sitting pretty on
            BBS LM wheels (sorry, Hert), this might be one of our favorite
            Hoonigan cars to date.

            from forgotten storage vehicle to 550hp fun machine.

            <p>We took a Skyline GTR shell and transformed it into a 645hp,
            ethanol breathing, top mount twins.
            (not really but you get to see it happen that fast).
            From the Blitz Twin Turbo kit to the bronze TE37's, this GTR does
            not disappoint. Completely built and restored at Driver Motorsports,
            no detail was overlooked.
            <p>Every part on this car was polished, painted
            or powder coated! She pulls hard on 100% E85 with 645WHP recorded on the dyno!
            To hold this power, she has a NISMO Coppermix twin-plate clutch and some sticky
            Toyo Tires. To address handling, we equipped her with some Fortune Auto coilovers.
            </p>
            If you haven't driven a car with Fortune Auto's, you need to. Many custom parts
            were fabricated in house. Just scope that custom intake box and turbo piping.
            From this inside out this car is simply sublime. We have put a lot of blood,
            sweat, and tears into this car. We have had several customers buy a car from
            us and take it to a car show and win and this car is a show stopper!

            <p>The Subaru BRZ is a compact two-door coupe rear-wheel
            drive sports car designed and manufactured jointly by Subaru and Toyota,
            officially unveiled in December 2011 at the Tokyo Motor Show.
            BRZ stands for Boxer, Rear Wheel Drive, Zenith.
          </p>
            <p>The BRZ has been a slow and steady progress since they day got it over 4 years ago.
               I know you guys know the brz is not finished i don't think it'll ever be like technically finished it's a build it's always going to be ongoing but i'm definitely going to say that it is done this phase this phase is done it's going to be like this for a while i'm going to drive around have some fun and just like  a heads up you guys getting into this  video you aren't just getting a  brz in 10 minutes video you are getting  a literal time capsule  of me and my channel growth and the  whole youtube game that i have been  involved in because one of my very first  videos was putting the nvidia n1 on this  car  and more importantly than anything to do  with this car or this build being recap  i just want you guys to like look at me  in those early videos a lot of the stuff  i can't even put in there because i  wasn't even really comfortable speaking  enough to the camera to the point where  like  the videos were a little bit weird a lot  of the time what i'm trying to say is  if you guys think you can't do it you  gotta keep going man like look where  these videos started  and look where we are now i hate to hit  you with the corniness but you guys stay  committed man there's literally nothing  as you mature and as you get to grow and  understand what you're doing  that you can't accomplish so pretty sure  this is like four years of brz building  i'm gonna wrap it up for you guys in  about 10 minutes  so what we have here is the brand new  nk tm7s  18 by nine and a halfs in the rear and  18 by eights in the front  but i'm pretty happy with it i'm i'm  really liking the way it looks.
